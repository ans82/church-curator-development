## About ChurchCurator
ChurchCurator is a SaaS-CMS (SoftwareAsAService Church Management Software).
It provides a set of useful tools to modern churches, church groups and members.
The user must not install any software on his computer, but can create a new
church account online within a few seconds, which immediately spawns a
"new church space" under a subdomain (e.g. my-church.church-curator.com).

From then on, this user is the administrator of this space and can use the base
functionality which concentrates on profiles, households and groups.
While this helps pastors or church leaders to keep the members list centralized,
secure and up to date, they can bundle people in households (making future
address updates a breeze) and map their church life into software by creating
groups which represent real life cell groups, teams or events.
SaaS software is much more secure, accessible and up to date, than having
address data on someones homecomputer.

But there are a lot more benefits to a SaaS supported church approach:
ChurchCurator allows to create as many user accounts as you need. The initial
user becomes administrator and may allow other people to join. He can give
other church leaders admin rights as well, but even non administrative users
have huge benefits: Once they log in, they have access to their groups. Groups
are like sub-spaces: Each group has its own chat, filepool, address list,
rosters and much more. It eliminates the pressure on all team leaders to
work with Facebook, Threema, Dropbox, Google drive, WhatsApp, Mails, SMS and
Excel Lists and all the other home baked solutions.

ChurchCurator has no native mobile app yet, but its webinterface is built with
Bootstrap and optimized for mobile access (a responsive website). This means
content adapts to your devices screensize.

In order to balance between simple and powerful, the userinterface starts out
very lean with profiles, households and groups. But with growing demand a church
can choose to activate "modules" which is from a users perspective "pushing a
knob" and new features appear. For example: If a church enables the pastoral
module, new buttons appear giving access to formerly unseen parts of the
software. With the pastoral module enabled, one can assign people to pastors.
People will see their pastors contact details and pastors have a "CRM (Customer
Relationship Management) like" interface where they can store notes on people,
see when and how they contacted whom and track their personal follow up
proceess. Administrators finally have charts and figures telling them what's
going on in the pastoral area.
